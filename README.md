# credit-risk-classification

This repository contains the work for the Credit Risk Classification project. The goal of this project was to build a machine learning model to predict whether a loan is high-risk or healthy based on a set of features from historical lending data. The project uses Logistic Regression to predict loan default risk, using Python and popular libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

Files in the Repository:

  /Resources/lending_data.csv
    
    Contains the historical lending data, which includes features about the borrowers and their loan status (healthy or high-risk).
    
  /credit_risk_classification.ipynb
    
    This Jupyter notebook contains the full code to preprocess the data, train the Logistic Regression model, and evaluate its performance.
    It also includes the steps taken for data analysis and model evaluation.

  /report_template.md
    
    A markdown template for writing the final project report, including sections like analysis overview, results, and recommendations.
